                <div class="description"> <p class="des">The first thing I want to tell you is that hamsters swim well. Yes, yes. We inflate our cheek pouches with air and paddle in the water with our little paws. My friend <span>Edgar</span> won first place in the hamster Olympic swimming games. I, of course, am not such a good swimmer, because usually there's food in my cheeks: if I have a chance to steal some seeds from my owners, I won't miss it. Recently, I found a magnet and also stored it in my cheek pouches for safekeeping, but then I got magnetized to the cage. I don't do that anymore.</p></div>

                <div class="description"> <p class="des">And also, my friend <span>Oliverindo</span> once found a whole watermelon when he was exploring the house. He protects our owners so that no burglars attack them. He will defend his owners with his little paws. He's a good boy, but he hasn't shown himself in action yet. I also thought about doing something useful for my owners. Maybe I'll get a part-time job and help with rent payment. I think I could be helpful, for example, I can steal seeds, fruit pieces, and cheese balls from the neighbor. So far, it's not going well, my owners didn't really appreciate all my efforts to escape to the neighbor and helpthem.</p></div>

                <div class="description"> <p class="des">But overall, we are all hamster brothers. Did you know that my friends <span>Edgar</span>,<span> Oliverindo</span>,<span> Helly</span>,<span>Darling</span>, and <span>Newton</span> are my distant relatives? I read on the internet that almost all golden domestic hamsters originated from one female who gave birth to 12 babies in 1930! I believe that I should know the history of my ancestors and share this information with you. So, I have many more brothers and sisters, there are a lot of them! Awesome:) We, hamsters, will conquer this world with our cheeks :3 I hope you enjoyed my mini blog, stay tuned for more! I will soon tell the story of how Oliverindo and I played by the fan. Love you all!</p></div>
